# 🧩 Sudoku Solver in Modern C++

A fully object-oriented and modular Sudoku Solver built using C++17, demonstrating a strong understanding of algorithms, backtracking, STL, clean architecture, and system design principles.

This project solves any valid 9×9 Sudoku puzzle using an optimized backtracking algorithm with validation checks for rows, columns, and 3×3 subgrids.
The codebase is structured into multiple classes to ensure scalability, readability, and reusability.

# 🌟 Why This Project? (What it Demonstrates)

This project highlights:

✔ Strong C++ fundamentals — classes, headers, references, const correctness, modular compilation

✔ Object-Oriented Design — Board, Solver, and Utility modules

✔ Use of STL containers — vector, unordered_set, array

✔ Algorithmic thinking — recursive backtracking with pruning

✔ Clean coding practices — separation of concerns, error handling, clarity

✔ Scalable structure — easy to upgrade to GUI, generators, or advanced algorithms

This is ideal for showcasing problem-solving + C++ design skills in a resume or interview.
